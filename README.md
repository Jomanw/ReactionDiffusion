# Reaction Diffusion System

Final project for 18.354 (Nonlinear Dynamics: Continuum Systems). Simulation of Reaction-Diffusion (RD) system with various RD schemes, goal being to create Turing Instabilities. Configure runs within `simulation.py`, and create new RD systems from within `turing_system.py`. To run, use the command: <br> <br>
`python3 simulation.py`.
